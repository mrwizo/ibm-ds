    "The ARPS (A Really Promising Startup) company, very committed to technological development, ecological culture, and the well-being of its workers, has grown very rapidly in the last year thanks to its good work and its innovative business model. For this reason, it anticipates going from having 13 workers to 50 in the next year, and has commissioned me to carry out a study to establish a new headquarters in the city of Madrid.\n",
